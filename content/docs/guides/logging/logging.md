#What is Logging?

Logging, in terms of a web server, is the ability for the server to output some information about the status of the server and/or interactions with said server. This information can be something simple like letting a user know the server has started successfully, to outputting errors with the server or even the user code.

##Next steps

[Add logging](./helium-logger): Get useful feedback from your server about startup and errors.
